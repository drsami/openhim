{"name":"OpenHIM","body":"The Open Health Information Mediator (OpenHIM) is a middleware system based on an ESB architecture that aims to enable easier interoperability between disparate Health Information Systems.\r\n\r\nWe plan to build a community of implementers and developers that support this work so that we can ease the burden of interoperability and enable information sharing between clinicians in real world projects.\r\n\r\nThe reference implementation of this is for the Rwandan Health Information Exchange (RHIE). The project is know as the RHEA (Rwandan Health Enterprise Architecture) project. Please see the RHEA wiki for more details:\r\n\r\n* [What is the HIM?](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10289633)\r\n* [Health Information Mediator Documentation](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/display/HIM/Health+Information+Mediator+-+Interoperability+Layer)\r\n* [RHEA Implementation wiki](https://jembiprojects.jira.com/wiki/display/RHEAPILOT/Home)\r\n\r\n## Community\r\nIf you would like to ask some questions or hold some discussions around the OpenHIM project please feel free to contact us on the OpenHIM Implementers mailing list (https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openhim-implementers). \r\n\r\nIf you would like to get involved with this project, more technical developer discussions will take place on the OpenHIM Developer mailing list (https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openhim-dev).\r\n\r\nWe hope to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThis project was originally developed by [Jembi Health Systems](http://www.jembi.org/) with collaboration with the [HEAL lab](http://cair.za.net/research/groups/heal) at [UKZN](http://ukzn.ac.za/). It was originally developed by Ryan Crichton, senior developer at Jembi Health Systems for the [RHEA project](http://rhea.jembi.org/).","tagline":"OpenHIM is a open source Health Information Mediator built to facilitate interoperability between disparate Health Information Systems.","note":"Don't delete this file!
